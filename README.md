# Assignment-4
Heap Data Structures - Implementation, Analysis, and Applications 
In this assignment, I did some heap data structure implementation and looked into how these data structures could be used for sorting and priority queues. The aim was to implement such structures, analyze the performance of the same, and apply them in real-world situations.

What I Did:
Heapsort Implementation:

I have implemented the Heapsort algorithm using a max-heap. This allows for efficient sorting of an array.
I have shown the time complexity in the worst, average and best case; hence I compared Heapsort with other sorting algorithms, such as Quicksort and Merge Sort.
Priority Queue:

I also included implementation of a priority queue by using a binary heap. It finds its application in job scheduling or managing items based on their priorities.
The priority queue provides functionality for the insertion of tasks, extracting the highest priority task, it also provides adjusting priorities of tasks.
What You'll Find:
You will see Python code that implements Heapsort and Priority Queue.
A report on my design decisions, the time complexity analysis, and comparisons with other algorithms.
Instructions on how to execute the code and summarize my findings.
Working on this assignment really helped me understand how heaps work in depth and how to use them efficiently in practical scenarios such as sorting and task scheduling.
